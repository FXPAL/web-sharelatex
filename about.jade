					h3 Motivation
					p There are two strong driving principles behind our work on ShareLaTeX:
					ul
						li
							strong We want to improve the workflow of as many people as possible.
							|  LaTeX is notoriously hard to use, and collaboration is always difficult to coordinate.
							| We believe that we've developed some great solutions to help people who face these problems,
							| and we want to make sure that ShareLaTeX is accessible to as many people as possible.
							| We've tried to keep our pricing fair, and have released much of ShareLaTeX as 
							a(href="https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex") open source
							|  so that anyone can host their own.
						li
							strong We want to create a sustainable and lasting legacy.
							|  Development and maintenance of a product like ShareLaTeX takes a lot of time and work,
							| so it's important that we can find a business model that will support this both now, and in the
							| long term. We don't want ShareLaTeX to be dependent on external funding or disappear due to a failed business model.
							| I'm pleased to say that we're currently able to run ShareLaTeX profitably and sustainably, and
							| expect to be able to do so in the long term.

					h3 Get in touch
					
					p
						| We'd love to hear from anyone who is using ShareLaTeX, or wants to have a chat about what we're doing. You can get in touch
						| with us at
