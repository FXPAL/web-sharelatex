							| Good news! Overleaf and ShareLaTeX have joined forces to bring
							| you Overleaf v2, which combines the best of both services.
							| Coming from ShareLaTeX, Overleaf v2 will be very familiar,
							| because it's built around the ShareLaTeX editor.

						p.text-center
							| You can access all your Overleaf and ShareLaTeX projects through
							| Overleaf v2. 
							if hasSubscription
								| Your Student / Collaborator / Professional subscription will
								| also be transferred automatically to Overleaf v2.

								| You already have an Overleaf account with the same email
								| address as your ShareLaTeX account, so we need you to log in
								| to Overleaf so we can merge your accounts.
