				h2.rfp-h2 ShareLaTeX is Revolutionizing LaTeX collaboration (again)
				p.rfp-lead We're obsessed with making ShareLaTeX as helpful as possible. In our conversations with users, we kept hearing how frustrating it could be to figure out what changes had been made by other collaborators.
				p.rfp-lead So we put our coding hats on and did something about it.
				p.rfp-lead Here's what some of our users said when we showed them the new comments and track changes features.
